# Learning AI

Hi people!
This is my personal repository where I'll put all my implementations about AI (from zero to -> I don't know! =P)

So, I really love JS and I gonna do these implementation using JS (judge me =P)!
For the first steps, I'm using *NumJS* that is *numpy*-like package.

That's it for now!
